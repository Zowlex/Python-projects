This is the python implementation of ![John Connway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), I had so fun working on this that's why I'll write a blog post about it in the next days.

   - Instructions:
      1. Set the desired resolution (w,h) and lunch `python ./gemeoflife.py`
      2. Draw the desired shape: 
         - right mouse click to fill the rectangle
         - left click to undo changes
      3. Press 'space' to start  
   
   - Updates:
      - blogpost: ![link to blogpost](http://fareslassoued.ml/2020/03/21/gameoflife.html)
      - added drawing functionality
      - added numpy version of grid which is faster and less computationally expensive (06-04-2020)
