### 3. Game Of life

   - This is the python implementation of ![John Connway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), I had so fun working on this that's why I'll write a blog post about it in the next days.

   - Instructions:
      1. Set the desired resolution (w,h) and lunch `python ./gemeoflife.py`
      2. Draw the desired shape: 
         - right mouse click to fill the rectangle
         - left click to undo changes
      3. Press 'space' to start

      - added drawing functionality
      - added numpy version of grid which is faster and less computationally expensive (06-04-2020)
### 4. MNIST guai 
   - This project is the extension of [this]() project from Hands-on ML book which consists of:
      - Training an MNIST digit classifier with the accuracy of 97% (only using a knn classifier,not a neural networks)
      - Exporting the model and using it for inference in a gui pygame app
      - Draw the digit with your mouse the app predicts which digit you drew
